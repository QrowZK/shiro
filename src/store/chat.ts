/**
 * Chat state: channels, private conversations and battle-room chat.
 *
 * This is a feature slice - it registers with store/slices.ts at module load
 * and receives the same per-animation-frame batch the core lobby store gets.
 * It deliberately owns nothing the core store owns; the only thing it copies is
 * our own account name, which it learns from `LoginResponse` (and which the UI
 * can also push in with `setMe`).
 *
 * Two constraints shape the imports here:
 *
 * - The unit tests run under Node's type-stripping loader, so this module must
 *   not import a TS `enum` (a runtime construct strip-only mode refuses) and
 *   must use explicit `.ts` extensions on runtime imports.
 * - `net/session.ts` reaches Tauri's `invoke` at import time, so it is pulled in
 *   lazily inside the send actions rather than at the top of the file. That
 *   keeps the reducer testable in plain Node with no Tauri shim.
