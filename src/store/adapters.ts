       The question this mark answers is who is delaying the start, and a
       spectator never is - `CmdStart` gathers players only. Marking them would
       put a red cross beside people nobody is waiting for.

       The seat keeps the row it built rather than a copy of it, so that the
       waiting list below can be subtracted from the spectators by identity. */

  /* Every team up to one past the highest in use, and never fewer than two.
     This used to be the ally numbers actually present, which made a team you
     could join a team somebody was already on: a fresh room showed one column,
     so there was nowhere to put a second side and hosting a 1v1 was impossible
     from this screen. `!balance 2` looked broken for the same reason - with
     everyone still on ally 0 there was only ever one column to show.

     Contiguous rather than sparse, because the gap between an occupied ally 0
     and an occupied ally 3 is two teams a person can join, not a hole. Capped
     at MAX_ALLY_TEAMS, which a room can genuinely exceed: `!balance N` is
     bounded only by the player count, so a 20-player custom room can be told
     to make twenty teams and will report ally numbers the script generator has
     no block for. Clamping means we stop offering columns at the last one that
     can actually start a game.

     Two is the floor rather than "one past the highest": a 1v1 that is already
     two columns does not need an empty third, and a room where everyone sits on
     ally 0 needs somewhere to send half of them. */
