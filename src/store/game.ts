/**
 * Getting from "I am in a battle" to "the engine is running".
 *
 * This is a feature slice - it registers with store/slices.ts at module load.
 * The whole flow is four steps (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md section 6):
 *
 *   RequestConnectSpring -> ConnectSpring -> write script.txt -> spawn engine
 *
 * Only the first is ours to initiate, and even that is optional: the server
 * pushes `ConnectSpring` unprompted when a matchmaker game starts or when you
 * reconnect to a match already in progress. So the launch is driven by the
 * *arrival* of `ConnectSpring`, never by the button that asked for it. Press
 * nothing and a matchmaker game still starts correctly.
 *
 * Rust owns everything past that point - locating the install, the script, the
 * process - so this module stays testable in plain Node: `net/launch.ts`
 * reaches for Tauri at import time and is therefore imported lazily.
