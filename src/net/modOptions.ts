/**
 * Modoptions: reading a room's option dictionary, and building the one to send.
 *
 * Two things about this dictionary are not obvious and are easy to get wrong,
 * so they live here rather than in a component:
 *
 * 1. **`SetModOptions` replaces, it does not merge.** `ServerBattle` assigns the
 *    dictionary it is given and broadcasts it. So the map we send is the room's
 *    whole state, and anything missing from it is gone - including keys we did
 *    not put there. The server sets `noelo` itself for non-vanilla games; an
 *    editor that sent only the options it has controls for would silently
 *    re-enable rating on a modded room. Every function here that produces a
 *    dictionary to send starts from the current one.
 *
 * 2. **Values are strings, and the formatting decides what counts as changed.**
 *    Whether an option reads as "the host changed this" is a string comparison
 *    against the default, so `"0.60"` and `"0.6"` are different answers to the
 *    same question. `formatNumber` is a port of the ZK client's `TextFromNum`
 *    for exactly that reason.
