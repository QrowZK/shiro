/**
 * Player profiles from zero-k.info.
 *
 * The lobby protocol tells us nothing about a player who is offline, and
 * `UserProfile` is server-to-client only, so another player's awards and
 * progression never arrive over the socket. The Zero-K developers were asked
 * for an endpoint and declined. `docs/PROFILES-WITHOUT-ENDPOINTS.md` has the
 * measurements; the fetching and parsing are in `src-tauri/src/zkweb.rs`,
 * behind the same host allowlist and timeout as the rest of our outbound HTTP.
 *
 * Everything here is an *enrichment*. A profile that fails to load must leave
 * the card we can already draw from the lobby record intact.
