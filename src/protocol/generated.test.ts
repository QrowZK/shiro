/**
 * The generated types must describe the wire, not the server's class files.
 *
 * `tools/gen-protocol.mjs` reads upstream C# and emits `types.ts`. Its member
 * pattern matched attributes and threw them away, so a member marked
 * `[JsonIgnore]` - which Newtonsoft drops in both directions - was emitted as
 * though it arrived. The result is the worst kind of wrong: a field that is
 * always `undefined` and typed as though it never is, so nothing complains and
 * the feature reading it silently does nothing.
 *
 * Two of those shipped. `MatchMakerSetup.Queue` declares `Mode`, `MinSize` and
 * `MaxSize` - exactly what a client would sort queues by - and marks all three
 * `[JsonIgnore]`, so a screen written against them read nothing. `User.PartyID`
 * is the same, and the party marker in the room has never once been drawn.
 *
 * These read the emitted file rather than run the generator: the generator
 * fetches upstream at a pinned SHA and a test that needs the network is a test
 * that fails on a train. Regenerating with a broken generator puts these fields
 * back, which is exactly when this should fail.
