//! Shiro's loading screen, placed into a data directory.
//!
//! Zero-K draws the screen between pressing start and the game appearing from
//! `luaintro/main.lua` inside its own game archive. That archive cannot be
//! touched - its checksum is what keeps a client in sync with the server - but
//! it does not have to be, because the first thing Zero-K's own script does is
//!
//! ```lua
//! VFS.DEF_MODE = VFS.RAW_FIRST
//! ```
//!
//! which searches the raw data directory before any archive. A file written to
//! `<datadir>/LuaIntro/Addons/main.lua` is therefore found ahead of Zero-K's
//! addon of the same name and replaces it. Nothing is patched, nothing is
//! injected, and the game's checksum is exactly what it was.
//!
//! **Every path here is spelled the way the engine spells it, capitals and
//! all.** The addon handler scans `LUA_DIRNAME .. 'Addons/'` and the addon asks
//! for `LuaIntro/Images/…`; a raw file is found by handing those strings to the
//! filesystem unchanged. Windows does not care about the difference and Linux
//! does, so a lowercase `addons/` is a screen that works on one platform and is
//! invisible on the other - which is exactly how it was reported.
//!
//! Two limits worth stating plainly:
//!
//! - **This rests on Zero-K's choice, not the engine's guarantee.** That
//!   `RAW_FIRST` line is in their script. If it goes, the file is simply
//!   ignored and the stock screen comes back - which is the safe way for it to
//!   fail.
//! - **Only where Shiro owns the directory.** A managed install is ours to
//!   write into. Somebody else's Steam installation is not, so this is not
//!   written there without being asked.
//!
//! The screen is three files, not one: the addon and the two pictures it draws.
//! They are installed and removed together, because an addon that reaches for a
//! texture nobody placed is worse than no addon at all.
