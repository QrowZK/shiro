//! Zero-K, installed by Shiro rather than found.
//!
//! Shiro has always needed somebody else to have installed the game. This is
//! the other mode: a directory Shiro owns, an engine fetched from Zero-K's own
//! server, and the game pulled in by the `pr-downloader` that arrives inside
//! that engine. Nothing here replaces detection - a Steam install is still used
//! when there is one, and the two modes sit side by side.
//!
//! The order matters and is the whole trick. The engine package contains
//! `pr-downloader`, so fetching one 45 MB zip turns an empty folder into
//! something that can fetch everything else. There is no bootstrap problem to
//! solve, and nothing here needs a cooperating third party: the engine comes
//! from `zero-k.info`, the game from `repos.springrts.com` over rapid, and both
//! are the same bytes the official client would install.
//!
//! What this deliberately does not do is decide *when*. Setting up an install
//! downloads gigabytes; it happens because somebody asked for it, in Settings,
//! and never because a battle wanted a map.
